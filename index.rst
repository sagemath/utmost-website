The UTMOST project is a CCLI Type 2 grant that promotes open-source
software and open-source curriculum in the undergraduate classroom.

Freely-available open software, open textbooks, and other open
curricular materials can allow teachers everywhere to transform the
undergraduate mathematics curriculum by tightly and seamlessly
integrating mathematics software with more traditional curricular
materials.




Open Software
-------------

We integrate `Sage <www.sagemath.org>`_ directly into open course materials.

* costly and time-consuming commercial licenses avoided
* curriculum steers software development
* usable anytime, anywhere, with just a web browser



Open Textbooks
--------------

Open course materials are freely available to anyone, anywhere.

* freely change and adapt course textbooks and materials
* freely distribute original or adapted textbooks and materials
* integrate technology easily
