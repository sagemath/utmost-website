Welcome

The UTMOST project is a CCLI Type 2 grant that promotes open-source
software and open-source curriculum in the undergraduate mathematics classroom.  For more details and the proposal, see the :doc:`About Us <about>` page.

Components
----------

* `SageMathCloud <https://cloud.sagemath.com>`_: a comprehensive cloud
  computing environment for education and scientific computing
* `Sage Cell Server <https://sagecell.sagemath.org>`_: embed live
  computations into any webpage
* `MathBook XML <http://mathbook.pugetsound.edu/>`_: a framework for
  writing mathematical material to publish in a variety
  of formats
* `Sage Education Workshops
  <http://wiki.sagemath.org/Workshops#Education_Days>`_: workshops for
  learning how to use Sage in education
* `AIM Open Textbook Initiative <http://aimath.org/textbooks/>`_:
  quality open-source textbooks


Freely-available open software, open textbooks, and other open
curricular materials can allow teachers everywhere to transform the
undergraduate mathematics curriculum by tightly and seamlessly
integrating mathematics software with more traditional curricular
materials.
