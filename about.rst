The UTMOST grant is a collaborative 3-year `CCLI Type 2 <http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2009/nsf09529/nsf09529.html>`_ grant which is funded during September 2010--September 2013.

Objectives
----------

#. We will create a system that makes it easy for authors to convert
   open textbooks and other curricular materials to Sage worksheets,
   interspersing runnable interactive demonstrations and exercises and
   live Sage code with publication-quality typeset mathematics.

#. We will convert existing mature open textbooks to this format and
   create new curricular materials targeting this format, as
   demonstrations and tests of both the technical and pedagogical
   aspects of this new approach.

#. We will partner with eight diverse institutions to test these
   materials in a wide variety of courses, and provide support for their
   use and assistance for the creation of new materials.

#. We will evaluate the effectiveness of our model for making it easy
   to adopt open mathematics software and textbooks and making it easy
   to create integrated open curricular materials, and we will measure
   the resulting impact on teaching practices and the learning of
   mathematics with the expert assistance of professional evaluators.

#. We will improve the Sage library and its surrounding infrastructure
   (e.g., server design, notebook usability, and collaboration tools)
   where the improvements have a direct and obvious benefit for
   undergraduate education.
